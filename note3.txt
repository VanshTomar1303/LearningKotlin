3. Kotlin is 100% Java interoperable
'--> means whenever two Java and Kotlin files exist together they can share data with each other.

4. No Primitives: Kotlin doesn't have primitive types but optimizes object counterparts for the JVM.

8. No new Keyword: Object creation is done by calling the constructor like a method.

9. Operator Overloading: Kotlin supports limited operator overloading.

10. Multiplatform: Kotlin can be compiled to bytecode for the JVM and JavaScript, allowing for both backend and frontend development.
